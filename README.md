# PoCN Project: Structure and Dynamics in Complex Networks

This repository contains the code and analysis for the final project in **Physics of Complex Networks (PoCN)**, focused on the structural and dynamical behavior of complex systems. The project is divided into three distinct tasks:

---

## Task 22: Epidemic Spreading on Temporal Networks

This task investigates SIS, SIR, and SEIR epidemic models on **activity-driven temporal networks**. Using agent-based simulations and mean-field theory, we explore:

- Temporal network construction based on heterogeneous activity rates.
- Monte Carlo simulations of contagion dynamics.
- Effects of temporal sparsity and adaptive behavior on epidemic peaks.
- Emergence of multiple waves due to behavioral feedback.

## Task 28: Voter Model Dynamics

We study how **network topology**—particularly the degree distribution—affects the dynamics of the **voter model**, focusing on:

- Evolution of interface density \( \rho(t) \) on different networks.
- Metastable states and survival time scaling.
- Comparison of scale-free (BA), exponential (EN), and Erdős–Rényi (RN) networks.
- Reproduction of key results from Suchecki et al. (2005).

## Task 44: Facebook Social Connectedness Index

This task involves building **country-level social networks** from the Facebook Social Connectedness Index (SCI), using:

- GADM and NUTS3 administrative regions.
- Node and edge construction with SCI weights.
- Spatial mapping and centroid computation.
- Statistical analysis of intra-country social structures.
